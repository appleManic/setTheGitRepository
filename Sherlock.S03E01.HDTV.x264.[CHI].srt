00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,460
is that quite clear? What do you
think of this shirt? Sherlock!

158
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,340
I will find your underground
terror cell, Mycroft.

159
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,820
Just put me back in London.

160
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I need to get to know the place
again, breathe it in.

161
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,540
Feel every quiver
of its beating heart.

162
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,700
One of our men died
getting this information.

163
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,060
All the chatter,
all the traffic concurs,

164
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,980
there's going to be a terrorist
strike on London, a big one.

165
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,900
And what about John Watson?

166
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,580
John? Mm. Have you seen him?
Oh, yes,

167
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,860
we meet up every Friday
for fish and chips !

168
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,820
I've kept a weather eye on him,
of course.

169
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,660
We haven't been in touch at all
to...prepare him.

170
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,460
No.

171
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,620
Well, we'll have to get rid of that.

172
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,820
"We?" He looks ancient.

173
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,420
I can't be seen to be wandering
around with an old man.

174
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,100

Well, I've got some news.

Oh, God, is it serious?

181

What? No, no, I'm not ill.

..moving on.

You're emigrating?

185
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Nope. Er, no, I've er...

186
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,820
..I have met someone.

187
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,780
Oh! Ah, lovely.

188
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,620
Yeah. We're getting married.
Well, I'm going to ask, anyway.

189
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,060
So soon after Sherlock?

190
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,500
Hmm, well, yes.

191
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,180
What's his name?

192
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,460
It's a woman.

193
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,940
A woman?! Yes, of course
it's a woman.

194
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,700
You really have moved on, haven't
you? Mrs Hudson, how many times?

195
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,020
Sherlock was not my boyfriend!

196
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,660
Live and let live, that's my motto.

197

You think so?

201
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,100
Mm, pop into Baker Street,
who knows, jump out of a cake.

202

He isn't there any more.

203
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,900
Why would he be?
It's been two years.

204
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,740
He's got on with his life.

205
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
What life? I've been away.

206
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,180
Where's he going to be tonight?
How would I know? You always know.

207
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,660
He has a dinner reservation
in the Marylebone Road.

208
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,260
Nice little spot.

209

of the 2000 Saint-Emilion,

I think maybe I'll just drop by.

You know, it is just possible
that you won't be welcome.

No, it isn't.

What? I don't care how
you faked it, Sherlock.

313
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,380
I want to know why.

314
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,660
Why? Because Moriarty
had to be stopped.

315
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Oh.

316
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,140
Why, as in...?

I see. Yes. Why?

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,180
Oh, so it was your brother's plan?

Oh, but he would have needed
a confidante.

Mm-hm.

Sorry.

326
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,100
But he was the only one?
The only one who knew?

327
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,540
A couple of others. It was a very
elaborate plan, it had to be.

The next of the 13 possibilities
was... Who else?

Who else knew?

330

Who?! Molly.

331

Molly?! John... Molly Hooper

One word, Sherlock,
that is all I would have needed!

not meant to have a problem with it,

a perfectly OK thing to do!

358

Shut up! I don't want everyone

look at us right now.

465
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,940
<font color="#D900D9">[BUZZER SOUNDS]</font>

466
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,420
Oh, bugger! Whoopsy!

467
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,340
Can't handle a broken heart.
How very telling.

468
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,900
Don't be smart.

469
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,420
That takes me back.

470
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,540
"Don't be smart, Sherlock,
I'm the smart one."

471
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,900
I am the smart one.

472
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,420
I used to think I was an idiot.

473
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,620
Both of us thought you were
an idiot, Sherlock.

474
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,700
We had nothing else to go on,
until we met other children.

475
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,500
Oh, yes, that was a mistake.
Ghastly. What were they thinking of?

476
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,900
Probably something about
trying to make friends.

477
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,620
Oh, yes. Friends.

478
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,820
Of course, you go in
for that sort of thing now.

479
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,460
And you don't? Ever?

480
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,300
If you seem slow to me, Sherlock,

481
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,900
can you imagine what real people
are like?

482
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,820
I'm living in a world of goldfish.

483
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,660
Yes, but I've been away
for two years.

484
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,620
So? Oh, I don't know,

485
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,300
I thought perhaps you might have
found yourself a...

486
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,740
"Goldfish". Change the subject, now.

487
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,860
Rest assured, Mycroft,

488
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,140
whatever this underground
network of yours is up to,

489
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,460
the secret will reside in something
seemingly insignificant or bizarre.

490
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,060
Ooh-ooh. Speaking of which...

491
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,940
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!

492
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,780
Him sitting in his chair again.

493
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,820
Oh, isn't it wonderful, Mr Holmes?

494
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,780
I can barely contain myself!
Oh, he really can, you know.

495
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,860
He's secretly pleased to see you,
underneath all that.

496
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,940
Sorry, which of us?

497
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Both of you.

498
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Let's play something different.

499
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Why are we playing games?!

500
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,060
London's terror alert has been
raised to critical,

501
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm just passing the time.

502
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,340
Let's do deductions.

503
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,860
Client left this while I was out,
what do you reckon?

504
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,740
I'm busy.

505
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh, go on, it's been an age.

506
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,980
<font color="#D900D9">[HE SNIFFS]</font>

507
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,860
I always win.
Which is why you can't resist.

508
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,660
I find nothing irresistible in the
hat of a well-travelled anxious,

509
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,380
sentimental, unfit creature of habit
with appalling halitosis.

510
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,660
Damn.
Isolated too, don't you think?

511
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,940
Why would he be isolated?

512
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,100
"He?" Obviously.
Why? Size of the hat?

513
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,700
Don't be silly.
Some women have large heads too.

514
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,460
No, he's recently had his hair cut,

515
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,020
you can see the little hairs adhering
to the perspiration stains on the inside.

516
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,340
Some women have short hair too.

517
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,481
Balance of probability.
Not that you've ever spoken

518
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,580
to a woman with short hair,
or, you know, a woman.

519
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,420
Stains show he's out of condition.
He's sentimental because the hat

520
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,900
has been repaired, three, four...
Five times. Very neatly.

521
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,983
The cost of the repairs
exceeds that of the hat,

522
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,980
he's mawkishly attached to it.
More than that.

523
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,220
One or two patches would
indicate sentimentality. But five?

524
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,460
Five's obsessive behaviour.
Obsessive compulsive.

525
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,860
Hardly. Your client left it behind.

526
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,100
What sort of an obsessive compulsive
would do that?

527
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,420
The earlier patches are extensively
sun bleached,

528
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,860
so he's worn it abroad, in Peru.

529
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,140
Peru? This is a chullo.

530
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,660
The classic headgear of Andes,
it's made of alpaca.

531
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,340
No. No? Icelandic sheep wool.
Similar, but very distinctive,

532
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,140
if you know what you're looking for.
I've written a blog on the varying

533
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
tensile strengths of different
natural fibres.

534
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,940
I'm sure there's a crying
need for that!

535
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,180
You said he was anxious? The bobble on
the left side has been badly chewed,

536
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,700
which shows he's a man of a nervous
disposition, but...

537
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,100
But also a creature of habit,

538
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,660
because he hasn't chewed
the bobble on the right. Precisely.

539
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,499
A sniff of the offending
bobble tells us all

540
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,420
we need to know about the
state of his breath.

541
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,860
Brilliant! Elementary.

542
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,980
But you've missed his isolation.

543
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,580
I don't see it.

544
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,820
Plain as day. Where?

545
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,180
There for all to see. Tell me.

546
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,660
Plain as the nose on your... Tell me!

547
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,700
Well, anybody who wears
a hat as stupid as this

548
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,180
isn't in the habit of hanging
around other people, is he?

549
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,860
Not at all. Maybe he just
doesn't mind being different.

550
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,180
He doesn't necessarily
have to be isolated.

551
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,700
Exactly.

552
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,620
I'm sorry?

553
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,580
He's different, so what?
Why would he mind?

554
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,060
You're quite right.

555
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,100
Why would anyone mind?

556
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
I am not lonely, Sherlock.

557
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,820
How would you know?

558
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,060
Yes. Back to work,
if you don't mind. Good morning.

Talk to John.

568
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,060
I've tried talking to him.
He made his position quite clear.

569

Just relax, Mr Summerson.

570
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,340

You wanted to see me?

Yes. Molly...

579
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,940
Yes? Would you...?

580
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,100
Would you like to...
Have dinner? ..Solve crimes?

581
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,540
Um...

582
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,980
Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of,
Mrs Reeves.

583
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,580
It's very common,
but I'm recommending a course of...

584
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,900
Monkey glands,
but enough about Professor Presbury.

585
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,220
Tell us more about your case, Mr Harcourt.
You sure about this? Absolutely.

586
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,740
Should I be making notes? If it makes you feel better.
That's what John says he does.

587
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,860
So if I'm being John... You're not
being John, you're being yourself.

588
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,060
Well, absolutely no one should have
been able to empty

that bank account other than myself
and Helen.

590
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,420
Why didn't you assume it was your wife?
Because I've always had total faith in her.

591
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,620
No, it's because YOU emptied it.

small infection, by the sound of it.

614

And British Birds.

What? What do you want?

621
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,820
Uh?

622
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,340
Have you come to torment me? What are you talking about?
"What are you talking...?"

623
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,940
What, do you think I'm going
to be fooled by this bloody beard?!

624
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,140
You're crazy! No, no, no, no, no.

Not as good as your French.

626

It's not even a good disguise,

627
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,540
Where did you get it from,
a bloody joke shop...?!

628
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,940

This going to be
your new arrangement, is it?

The corpse is, is six months old.

672
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,100
It's dressed in a shoddy Victorian
outfit from a museum.

673
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,220
It's been displayed on a dummy
for many years,

674
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,580
in a case facing south-east, judging
from the fading of the fabric.

675
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,860
It was sold off in a fire damage sale
a week ago.

676
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,020
So the whole thing was a fake?

677
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,260
Yes.

678
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,060
Looked so promising.

679
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,100
Facile.

680
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Why would someone go to all
that trouble?

681
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,420
Why indeed, John?

684
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,820
No problem.

685
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,420
So, what's this all about,
Mr Shilcott?

686
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,380
My girlfriend's a big fan of yours.

687
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,580
Girlfriend?!

688
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,180
Sorry. Do go on.

689
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,020
I like trains.

690
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,700
Yes... I work on the Tube, on the
District Line, and part of my job

691
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,300
is to wipe the security footage
after it's been cleared.

692
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,220
I was just whizzing through
and I found something a bit bizarre.

693
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,700
Now, this was a week ago.

694
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,300
The last train on the Friday night,
Westminster Station.

695
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,580
Now, this man gets into
the last car.

696
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,660
Car? They're cars, not carriages.

697
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,500
It's a legacy of the early American
involvement in the Tube system.

698
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,940
He said he liked trains.

699
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,620
And the next stop,
St James's Park Station.

700
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,100
And...

701
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,900
I thought you'd like it.

702
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,020
He gets into the last car
at Westminster. The only passenger.

703
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,620
And the car is empty
at St James's Park Station.

704
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,620
Explain that, Mr Holmes.

705
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,260
Couldn't he have just jumped off? There's a
safety mechanism that prevents the doors

706
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,740
from opening in transit.
But there's something else,

707
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,020
the driver of that train
hasn't been to work since.

708
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,100
According to his flatmate, he's
on holiday. Came into some money.

709
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,500
Bought off?

710
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,140
Hmm?

711
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,020
So if the driver of the train
was in on it,

712
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,540
then the passenger did get off.

713
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,700
There's nowhere he could go. It's a straight run
on the District Line between the two stations.

714
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,220
There's no side tunnels,
no maintenance tunnels.

715
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,860
Nothing on any map. Nothing.

716
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,940
Train never stops
and a man vanishes.

717
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,540
Good, innit?

718
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,260
I know that face.

719

<font color="#D900D9">[JOHN CLEARS HIS THROAT]</font>

720
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,500
Excuse you!

721
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,540
The journey between those stations
usually takes five minutes

722
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,820
and that one took ten. Ten minutes to get
from Westminster to St James's Park.

723
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,140
I'll need maps, lots of maps.
Older maps, all the maps. Right.

724
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,100
Fancy some chips? What?

725
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,660
I know a fantastic fish shop
just off the Marylebone Road,

726
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,700
the owner always gives me
extra portions.

727
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,220
Did you get him off a murder charge?

728
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,860
No, I helped him
put up some shelves.

729
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,060
Sherlock? Hmm?

730
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,100
What was today about?
Saying thank you.

731
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,980
For what?

732
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,540
For everything you did for me.
It's OK. It's my pleasure.

733
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,140
No. I mean it.

734
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,580
I don't mean pleasure,
I mean I didn't mind.

735
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,340
I wanted to... Moriarty slipped up,
he made a mistake.

736
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,660
Because the one person he thought
didn't matter at all to me

737
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,020
was the one person
that mattered the most.

738
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,660
You made it all possible.

739
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,620
But you can't do this again,
can you?

740
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,460
I've had a lovely day.
I'd love to, I just, um...

741
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,820
Hmm, congratulations, by the way.

742
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,260
He's not from work.

743
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,700
We met through friends,
old-fashioned way.

744
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,860
He's nice, we've got a dog,
we, we go to the pub on weekends

745
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,740
and I've met his mum and dad
and his friends and all his family.

746
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,860
I've no idea why I'm telling
you any of this...

747
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,220
I hope you'll be very happy,
Molly Hooper.

748
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,460
You deserve it.

749
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,260
After all, not all the men you fall
for can turn out to be sociopaths.

750
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,860
No? No.

Anyway, it was then that
I first noticed it was missing.

813
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,140
I said, "Have you checked

Oh, keys, small change, sweeties.

817
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,300
Especially his glasses. Glasses.

818
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,660

We managed to see St Paul's,

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,100
but they weren't letting
anyone into Parliament.

Yes, wonderful. Just get out!

In town for a few days.

Your parents? Mycroft promised to
take them to a matinee of Les Mis.

847
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,780

What?

852
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,900
I mean, they're just so...

853
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,420
..ordinary.

854
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,900
It's a cross I have to bear.

855
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,900
Did they know too?

856
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,980
Hmm? That you spent the last
two years playing hide and seek?

857
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,980
Maybe. Ah, so that's why
they weren't at the funeral!

858
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Sorry, sorry again. Hmm.

859
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,860
Sorry.

860
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,340
So you've shaved it off then?

861
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,740
Yeah. Wasn't working for me.

862
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,820
Yeah, I'm glad. You didn't like it?

863
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,620
No, I prefer my doctors
clean-shaven.

864
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,940
That's not a sentence
you hear every day.

865
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,900
How are you feeling?

866
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,460
Yeah, not bad. Bit smoked.

867
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,540
Right.

868
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,340
Last night, who did that?

869
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,580
And why did they target me?

870
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,860
I don't know.

871
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,740
Is it someone trying
to get to you through me?

872
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,540
Is it something to do with this
terrorist thing you talked about?

873
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,340
I don't know, I can't see
the pattern. It's too nebulous.

874
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,689
Why would an agent give his
life to tell us something

875
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,820
incredibly insignificant?
That's what's strange.

876
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,540
Give his life?
According to Mycroft.

877
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,820
There's an underground network planning
an attack on London, that's all we know.

These are my rats, John. Rats?

880
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,860
My markers, agents, lowlifes.
People who might find themselves

881
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,540
arrested or their diplomatic
immunity suddenly rescinded.

882
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,380
If one of them starts acting
suspiciously, we know something's up.

883
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,980
Five of them are behaving perfectly
normally, but the sixth...

884
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,100
I know him, don't I?

885
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,260
Lord Moran, Peer of the Realm.
Minister for Overseas Development.

886
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,780
Pillar of the Establishment. Yes.

887
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,900
He's been working for North Korea
since 1996.

888
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,820
What? He's the big rat,
rat number one.

889
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,660
He's just done something
very suspicious indeed.

890
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,980
Yeah, that's odd.

891
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,780
There's nowhere
he could have got off?

892
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,940
Not according to the maps.

893
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,380
There's something, something,
something I'm missing.

894
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,420

<font color="#D900D9">[PHONE BEEPS]</font>

Any idea who they are,
this underground network?

897
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,860

of the most obvious ones.

898
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,420
Our rat's just come out of his den.

899
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,620
Al-Qaeda? The IRA have been getting
restless again,

900
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,620
maybe they're going to make an
appearance... Yes, yes, yes, yes!

901
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,140
I've been an idiot, a blind idiot!

902
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,540
What? Oh, that's good.
That could be brilliant!

903
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,860
What are you on about? Mycroft's
intelligence is not nebulous at all,

904
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,580
it's specific, incredibly specific.

905
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,860
What do you mean?

906
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,620
It's not an Underground network,
John, it's an "Underground network!"

907
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,460
Right.

908
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,060
What? Sometimes a deception
is so audacious, so outrageous

909
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,260
that you can't see it even when
it's staring you in the face. Look,

910
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,380
seven carriages
leave Westminster. Mm.

911
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,260
And only six carriages
arrive at St James's Park.

912
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,380
Ah, but that's, I mean,
it's impossible.

913
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,580
Moran didn't disappear.
The entire tube compartment did.

914
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,820
The driver must have diverted the train
and then detached the last carriage.

915
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,660
Detached it where? You said there
was nothing between those stations.

916
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,940
Not on the maps, but once
you eliminate the other factors,

917
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,500
the remaining thing must be the truth. That
carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.

918
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,020
But why, though?

919
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,580
Why detach it in the first place?

920
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,540
It vanishes between St James's Park
and Westminster.

921
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,260
Lord Moran vanishes.

922
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,260
You're kidnapped and nearly burnt
to death at a fireworks party.

923
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,380
What's the date, John, today's date?

924
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,900
Hmm? November the...

925
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,020
Oh, God!

926
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,700
Lord Moran,
he's a Peer of the Realm.

927
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,020
Normally he'd sit in the House.

928
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,900
Tonight, there's an all-night sitting
to vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.

929
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,500
But he won't be there, not tonight.

930
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Not the 5th November.

931
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,220
"Remember, Remember..."

932
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,940
"Gunpowder, treason and plot!"

933
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,540
'There's nothing down there,
Mr Holmes, I told you.'

934
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,180
'No sidings, no ghost stations.'

935
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,620
There has to be, check again.

936
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,900
This whole area is a big mess
of old and new stuff.

937
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,180
Charing Cross is made up
of bits of older stations,

938
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,700
like Trafalgar Square, Strand.

939
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,900
No, it's none of those,
we've accounted for those.

940
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,020
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street,
Sumatra Road, Parliament Street...

941
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,100
'Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road?'

942
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,540
'You mentioned Sumatra Road,
Mr Holmes? There is something,'

943
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,060
'I knew it rang a bell! Yes.'

944
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,620
'There was a station down there.'

945
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,380
Well, why isn't it on the maps?

946
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,900
'Because it was closed
before it ever opened.' What?

947
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,380
'They built the platforms, even the
staircases, but it all got tied up'

948
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,540
'in legal disputes and so they never
built the station on the surface.'

949
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,820
It's right underneath
the Palace of Westminster.

950
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,540
So what's down there, a bomb?

951
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,980
Oh.

952
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,180
<i>'With many commentators saying'</i>

953
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,860

will be too close to call,'</i>

961
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,620
Must be. Right.

962
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,220

I'm calling the police. What? No!

963
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,980
Sherlock, this isn't a game,
they need to evacuate Parliament.

964
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:53,300
They'll get in the way, they always
do. This is cleaner, more efficient.

965
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,420
And illegal?
A bit.

966
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,820
What are you doing?

967
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,100
Coming.

968
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,620
I don't understand.
Well, that's a first.

969

Perfectly safe as long as we avoid

Of course, yeah,
avoid the rails. Great!

Well, think of something.
Why do you think I know what to do?

993
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,180
Because you're Sherlock Holmes,
you're as clever as it gets.

994
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,300
It doesn't mean I know how
to diffuse a giant bomb!

What about you?! I wasn't in bomb
disposal, I'm a bloody doctor!

And a soldier,
as you keep reminding us all!

Can't... Can't we rip
the timer off, or something?

The criminal network Moriarty
headed was vast.

'Its roots were everywhere, like a

just hints as to the extent

destroy my reputation, bit by bit.

out and given a code name.'

'It wasn't just my reputation
that Moriarty needed to bury.'

'It's a trick.'

1084
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,380
'It's just a magic trick.'

1085
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,580
'All right, stop it now.'

1086
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,500
'Now, stay exactly where you are.'

1087
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,460
'Don't move!'

1088
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,020
All right.

1089
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,300
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1090
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,140
Please, will you do this for me?

'It was vital that John stayed
just where I'd put him

'and that way his view was blocked
by the ambulance station.'

1094

'I needed to hit the air-bag,'

1095
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,220
'which I did.'

1096
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,900
'Speed was paramount.'

1097
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,020
'The air-bag needed to be got
out of the way'

1098
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,540
'just as John cleared the station.'

1099
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,020
'But we needed him to see a body.'

1100
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,540
'That's where Molly came in.'

1101
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,460
'Like figures on a weather clock, we
went one way, John went the other.'

1102
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,700
'Then, our well-timed cyclist...'

'..put John briefly out of action,'

with the corpse on the pavement.'

01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,660
'The rest was just window dressing.'

1106
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:00,740
'And one final touch,
a squash ball under the armpit.'

1107
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,220
'Apply enough pressure and it
momentarily cuts off the pulse.'

1108
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,180
Let me come through, please!

1109
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,740
It's all right...
No, he's my friend.

1110
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,020
It's all right.
No, he's my friend.

1111
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,580
It's all right, it's all right...
He's my friend, please.

1112
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,580
Everything was anticipated,
every eventuality allowed for.

1113
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,260
It worked perfectly.

1114
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,260
Molly. Molly Hooper?
She was in on it?

1115
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,100
Yes. You remember the little girl
who was abducted by Moriarty?

1116
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,100
<font color="#D900D9">[SHE SCREAMS]</font>

1117
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,380
Get out!

1118

'You assumed she reacted like that
because I was her kidnapper.'

1119
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,740
But I deduced Moriarty must have
found someone who looked

1120
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,380
very like me to plant suspicion,
and that that man, whoever he was,

1121
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,380
had to be got out of the way
as soon as his usefulness ended.

1122
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,660
That meant there was a corpse
in the morgue somewhere

1123
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,820
that looked just like me.

1124
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,100
Clever.

1125
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,940
Molly found the body,
faked the records

1126
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,420
and I provided the other coat.

1127
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,940
I've got lots of coats.

1128
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,740
What about the sniper
aiming at John?

1129

'Mycroft's men intervened before
he could take the shot.'

1130
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,820
'He was invited to reconsider.'

the whole street was closed off.

Like a scene from a play.

1137
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,260
Neat, don't you think?

1138
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,940
Hmm...

Not the way I'd have done it.

1141
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,460
Oh, really?

1142
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,620
No, I'm not saying
it's not clever, but... What?

1143
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,580
Bit...disappointed.

1144

Oh. Everyone's a critic.
Anyway, that's not why I came.

No? No, I think you know
why I'm here, Phillip.

"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper?"

1147
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Didn't you think it was intriguing?

1148
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,740
Lurid. A case so sensational
you hoped I'd be interested.

1149
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:09,540
But you overdid it, Phillip.
You and your little fan-club.

1150
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,460
I just couldn't live with myself,
knowing that I'd driven you to...

1151
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,660
But you didn't. You were
always right, I wasn't dead.

1152
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:21,660
No. No, and everything's OK now,
isn't it?

01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1154
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,540
Though of course you've
wasted police time.

1155
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,460
Perverted the course of justice.

1156
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,300
Risked distracting me from a massive
terrorist assault that could have

both destroyed Parliament and caused
the death of hundreds of people.

01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,620
Being Sherlock Holmes.

1235
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,580
I don't even know what
that's supposed to mean.

1236
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:39,140
Sherlock, you are going to tell me
how you did it?

1237
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,020
How you jumped off
that building and survived?

1238
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,580
You know my methods, John,
I am known to be indestructible.

1239
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:49,020
No, but seriously.

1240
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,740
When you were dead,
I went to your grave.

1241
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,220
I should hope so.

1242
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,580
I made a little speech.

1243
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,660
I actually spoke to you.

1244
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,460
I know. I was there.

1245
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,380
I asked you for one more miracle.

1246
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,540
I asked you to stop being dead.

1247
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,300
I heard you.

1248
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,900
Anyway, time to go
and be Sherlock Holmes.
